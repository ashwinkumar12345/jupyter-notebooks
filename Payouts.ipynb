    "You can use the Payouts API to automatically reconcile transactions to and from the seller's banking destination to ensure that everything adds up. There are two steps in the reconciliation process: comparing the deposit amount from the bank statement to the payout amount and identifying which transactions go into each payout.\n",

    "## Example use case\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where a seller runs several coffee shops across the country. The coffee shops process thousands of card payments per week. The seller has set up an automated payout schedule, whereby Square sends a payout to the seller's bank account at the end of each day. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might use the Payouts API to review the summary of all payouts to make sure it matches the seller's bank account balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also have the following use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Processing fees** - Compute processing fees for a payout by iterating through all payout entries. For example, if a payout has four entries: one charge for $100 with a $2 fee, one loan repayment for –$10, one refund for –$50 with a $1 fee, and a loan repayment refund for –$5, the total processing fee amount for this payout is $1. This is calculated as $2 + $0 – $1 + $0.\n",
    "* **Online marketplace** - An online marketplace app uses the Payouts API to see a list of deposits and withdrawals from a seller's banking destination. This could involve multiple sellers simultaneously reconciling their transactions.\n",
    "* **Subscription services** - A subscription-based service uses the Payouts API to reconcile regular payments to content creators.\n",
    "* **Retail refunds** - A retail business uses the Payouts API to track refunds for customers. This could involve the partial or full refund of purchases made in-store or online.\n",
    "* **Service marketplace** - A service marketplace, such as a home services platform, uses the Payouts API to track payments to service providers after they complete jobs."
